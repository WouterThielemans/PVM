= `switch_endianness`

MIDI files are <<../../background-information/endianness.asciidoc#,big endian>> (also, see http://pvm.leone.ucll.be/topics/endianness.pdf[slides]), whereas your machine is *very* probably little endian.
We need a way to translate between both.

[NOTE,caption={task-caption}]
====
Define the following three functions in the `io` <<../../background-information/namespace.asciidoc#,namespace>>:

[source,c++]
----
void switch_endianness(uint16_t* n);
void switch_endianness(uint32_t* n);
void switch_endianness(uint64_t* n);
----

These functions must reverse the order of the bytes in the given integer.
====

As always, put the declarations in a `.h` file and the corresponding definitions in a `.cpp` file.
Note that the tests expect you to name these files a certain way, so go take a look at them in order to determine what filenames you should use.

[NOTE]
====
In order to shift bytes around, you should rely on http://pvm.leone.ucll.be/topics/bit-manipulation.pdf[bit manipulation operators] such as `&`, `|`, `<<` and `>>`.
====

[NOTE]
====
If you have problems running the tests, remember to follow the instructions laid out on the <<../../setup.asciidoc#ide,setup page>>.
