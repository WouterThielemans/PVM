= Implementation

This folder contains step-by-step instructions of how to implement your MIDI project.

* link:01-io/[General IO functionality]
* link:02-midi/[Reading MIDI files]
* link:03-visualization/[Rendering MIDI files]

== Tests

Note that, initially, the test files are *not* included in your project.
This is due to the fact that otherwise you'd have to finish the entire project before being able to compile the tests.

For every step in this guide, there is a corresponding test suite in the project.
You can include it by right clicking on it in the Solution Explorer and selecting "Include In Project".
You can then proceed to write code to make these tests pass.

You are of course free to comment out some tests so as to make a more gradual development possible.
With each passing test, you can uncomment the next one.

You are not allowed to modify the tests in anyway unless explicitly mentioned otherwise.
If you think some tests make unnecessary assumptions, send me an email so that I can take it into consideration.
