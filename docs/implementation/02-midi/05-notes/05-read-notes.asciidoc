= `read_notes`

This step is the culmination of all previous ones: you'll read an entire MIDI file and return a list of all notes contained within in.

[NOTE,caption={task-caption}]
====
Write the function `read_notes` with signature

[source,c++]
----
std::vector<NOTE> midi::read_notes(std::istream& in)
----

* The given `istream` contains the entire MIDI file.
* It extract the notes and returns an `std::vector<NOTE>`.
* It starts by reading an MThd chunk, from which it learns how many MTrks there are.
* Next, it proceeds to read all these MTrks chunks and collects all notes in a vector.
* This vector is ultimately returned.

This function should be easy to implement: all complexity has already been taken care of in earlier steps.
