= `CHUNK_HEADER`

As explained in the <<../../../background-information/midi.asciidoc#chunks,MIDI background information>>, each chunk describes itself in its header.
We now define a C++ data structure that mirrors this structure exactly.
For example, say the documentation states the chunk header contains three 32-bit unsigned integers, you should define the struct as

[source,c++]
----
struct CHUNK_HEADER
{
    uint32_t first;
    uint32_t second;
    uint32_t third;
};
----

[NOTE,caption={task-caption}]
====
Define the struct `CHUNK_HEADER` to store chunk header data.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Rely on the `uint8_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t` and `uint64_t` types to make sure your data types have the correct size.
These are defined in the `cstdint` library header file.
====

TIP: The tests perform thorough checks to ensure you defined `CHUNK_HEADER` correctly.
Looking at them might yield some insights as to how you're supposed to define the struct.
