= Note On Events

[NOTE,caption={task-caption}]
====
Add support for <<../../../background-information/midi.asciidoc#noteon,note on events>> to `read_mtrk`.
====

As you may remember from the <<../../../background-information/midi.asciidoc#noteonzerovelocity,MIDI background information>>, note on events with velocity set to 0 are equivalent to note off events.
`read_mtrk` should **not** implement this rule: this special case is dealt with elsewhere.
Have `read_mtrk` simply call `note_on` whenever a note on event is encountered, regardless of the velocity.
